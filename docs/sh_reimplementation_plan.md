# Addressing Environment Variable Management in xv6rs Shell

## Introduction
The current implementation of environment variables in xv6rs presents limitations, particularly with the `export` command. This command sets environment variables only within the child process, which does not affect the parent shell process. This document outlines the challenges and proposes a plan to re-implement the `sh` shell in Rust to address these issues.

## Current Challenges
- The `export` command affects only the child process, leaving the parent shell's environment variables unchanged.
- The lack of a Rust implementation for the `sh` shell limits the ability to modify and extend its functionality.

## Proposed Solution
To resolve these issues, we propose re-implementing the `sh` shell in Rust. This will allow direct manipulation of environment variables within the shell process. The `export` command will be handled specially to update environment variables in the parent shell process without spawning a child process.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Project Setup**: Create a new Rust file for the shell implementation.
2. **Basic Shell Functionality**: Implement command input and parsing.
3. **Command Execution**: Implement command execution logic with special handling for `export`.
4. **Environment Variable Management**: Implement data structures for managing environment variables.
5. **Testing and Debugging**: Test the shell implementation and debug as necessary.
6. **Build and Replace**: Build the Rust shell and replace the existing binary.

## Conclusion
The new implementation will allow for more robust environment variable management and extend the functionality of the `sh` shell. Future enhancements could include additional shell features and optimizations.
